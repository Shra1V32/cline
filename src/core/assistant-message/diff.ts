/**
 * This function reconstructs the file content by applying a streamed diff (in a
 * specialized SEARCH/REPLACE block format) to the original file content. It is designed
 * to handle both incremental updates and the final resulting file after all chunks have
 * been processed.
 *
 * The diff format is a custom structure that uses three markers to define changes:
 *
 *   <<<<<<< SEARCH
 *   [Exact content to find in the original file]
 *   =======
 *   [Content to replace with]
 *   >>>>>>> REPLACE
 *
 * Behavior and Assumptions:
 * 1. The file is processed chunk-by-chunk. Each chunk of `diffContent` may contain
 *    partial or complete SEARCH/REPLACE blocks. By calling this function with each
 *    incremental chunk (with `isFinal` indicating the last chunk), the final reconstructed
 *    file content is produced.
 *
 * 2. Exact Matching with Fallback:
 *    - For each SEARCH block, the exact text must appear in the original file after
 *      `lastProcessedIndex`. If it does, that portion of the original file will be replaced.
 *    - If no exact match is found using a plain `indexOf`, we fall back to a line-by-line
 *      comparison that ignores leading/trailing whitespace. This is useful if the AI-generated
 *      search content differs slightly in indentation or spacing from the original code.
 *    - If neither exact nor trimmed line-based match is found, an error is thrown.
 *
 * 3. Empty SEARCH Section:
 *    - If SEARCH is empty and the original file is empty, this indicates creating a new file
 *      (pure insertion).
 *    - If SEARCH is empty and the original file is not empty, this indicates a complete
 *      file replacement (the entire original content is considered matched and replaced).
 *
 * 4. Applying Changes:
 *    - Before encountering the "=======" marker, lines are accumulated as search content.
 *    - After "=======" and before ">>>>>>> REPLACE", lines are accumulated as replacement content.
 *    - Once the block is complete (">>>>>>> REPLACE"), the matched section in the original
 *      file is replaced with the accumulated replacement lines, and the position in the original
 *      file is advanced.
 *
 * 5. Incremental Output:
 *    - As soon as the match location is found and we are in the REPLACE section, each new
 *      replacement line is appended to the result so that partial updates can be viewed
 *      incrementally.
 *
 * 6. Partial Markers:
 *    - If the final line of the chunk looks like it might be part of a marker but is not one
 *      of the known markers, it is removed. This prevents incomplete or partial markers
 *      from corrupting the output.
 *
 * 7. Finalization:
 *    - Once all chunks have been processed (when `isFinal` is true), any remaining original
 *      content after the last replaced section is appended to the result.
 *    - Trailing newlines are not forcibly added. The code tries to output exactly what is specified.
 *
 * Errors:
 * - If the search block cannot be matched exactly or with the line-trimmed fallback approach,
 *   an error is thrown.
 */

/**
 * Attempts a line-trimmed fallback match for the given search content in the original content.
 * It tries to match `searchContent` lines against a block of lines in `originalContent` starting
 * from `lastProcessedIndex`. Lines are matched by trimming leading/trailing whitespace and ensuring
 * they are identical afterwards.
 *
 * Returns [matchIndexStart, matchIndexEnd] if found, or false if not found.
