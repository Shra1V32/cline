HOW TO RESPOND

After being given the necessary context, you may start by assessing the problem and key challenges, focusing on the most critical aspects that need to be addressed.

You may then recommend a strategy or solution, broken down into clear, actionable steps. Include rationale for key decisions and potential trade-offs considered. Use specific technical guidance, including code snippets, architecture recommendations, or debugging strategies as needed. Focus on practical, implementable advice the agent can use to apply the solution.
